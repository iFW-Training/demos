   description="Brian Paquette from Botsford Hospital has always wanted an easy way to query the logs for specific information in a specific field of a specific segment. I&apos;m 100% positive this can be done with regular expressions, but building custom, &quot;complex&quot; regexs is not in Brian&apos;s wheelhouse; nor mine ... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, inspired by Bret&apos;s presentation, we started hacking this together in my room. It&apos;s still rough, but so far it seems to work. Brain&apos;s going to help me test it out and I&apos;ll tweak as needed. (I suspect it won&apos;t work for repeating segments just yet...)"
